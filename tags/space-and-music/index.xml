      <description>C Flute, 40 mins duration
Background and new 2019 Realisation Quantform Series is an unusual 20 movement work for solo flute where each movement is precisely matched to the acoustics of the site in which it is to be performed. Each of the twenty movements is written to match a different acoustic space. The choice of which movements to perform, and in what order, is up to the performer.</description>
