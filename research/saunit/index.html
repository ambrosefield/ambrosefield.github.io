<p>2019 | Scores for a rehearsal process</p>

<h2 id="information">Information</h2>

<p>A series of pieces where the musicians structure an off-line
design process themselves. The score describes these activities, rather than a performance.</p>

<h3 id="scoring-the-rehearsal-process-not-the-performance">Scoring the rehearsal process, not the performance</h3>

<p>The purpose of this work is to investigate what a score for a &lsquo;rehearsal process&rsquo; might be (rather than a score aimed at a &lsquo;realisation&rsquo; of a &lsquo;performance&rsquo;.) A parametric, modular score is given where musicians are encouraged to think about the <em>workflow of a design process</em>, rather than to generate sound in a responsive manner to visual stimuli.</p>

<p>Whilst plenty of scores from Medieval Music to Open Form composition address the challenges of creatively empowering performers, few address the actual rehearsal process itself: the <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> of collaborative decision making <em>whilst in the act of assembling a piece</em>. <em>Self-Assembly Unit</em> series of pieces explores these questions.</p>

<h3 id="on-timelines-and-improvisation">on timelines and improvisation</h3>

<p>Timelines are often seen as restrictive by improvisers, and graphic score, whilst open-ended, still offers the possibility that the interpretation of even the most abstract visuals will be measured against the works previously made by a particular composer, or failing that, within a broader tradition to which the graphics might be perceived to belong. I wanted to reject both of these notions, by turning over the timeline construction as an explicit and defined process to the musicians, in such a way that the process of assembly here has both real-time, and <em>off-line</em> elements to it.</p>

<h3 id="modular-score">Modular score</h3>

<p>Self-Assembly Unit Series is inspired by authorship debates and flatpack furniture. Self-Assembly Unit is a series of modular works which include the basic ingredients from which a piece might be rehearsed.</p>

<h3 id="reproducible-research">Reproducible research</h3>

<p>In research, reproducible-research means that it is possible to inspect the working (generally: code, raw data, processing methods) behind the conclusions presented. I wanted to expose the &lsquo;internals&rsquo; of a composition process to performers, and structure <em>how</em> the assembly of elements is made. To do this, all the internal elements that go into <em>the process of</em> making up a piece are exposed to the musicians, for change and modification. This is a different way of working to, for example, improvising around a stimulus, as longer-term structural decision making is required to define a collaborative sequence of events. <em>Self Assembly Unit</em> is a score for the <em>workflow</em> of assembly.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-call-you-performers-or-composers">Do I call you performers or composers?</h3>

<p><em>Self assembly unit</em> makes no assumptions about a performance occurring from the score in real-time: there is no sense of &lsquo;realisation&rsquo; (in a performative sense) here. Instead, design relationships are suggested around which the performer can generate a complex web of materials. This score then is entirely off-line and non-realtime. It also has nothing to do with the <em>act</em> of performance either, although it prepares the way for this. If you are <em>musicians</em> - a term encompassing performers and composers, then what am I? I&rsquo;m happy with the idea of being <em>designer</em> for this piece. I&rsquo;ve set the overall parameters, but the workflow of creativity is up to you.</p>
