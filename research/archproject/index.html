<h2 id="the-architexture-series-musicc">The Architexture Series Musicc</h2>

<p>The <em>Architexture Series</em> of works makes use of the sonic profile of
buildings as an evidence base for musical composition.</p>

<p>Detailed links between the musical score and the unique spatial and
acoustic characteristics of the performance site are embedded within
these compositions. Modelling the acoustic in this way during the
musical composition process can help achieve a closer bond between the
notes on the page and the sound perceived by listeners. The purpose of
this project is to blur the lines between space, live-art and
performance by allowing the situated built environment to become an
essential part of a living and evolving musical construction process.</p>

<p>Traditionally, composers for centuries have anticipated how spaces are
appropriate for the music they write, and acoustic music generally
reflects the constraints of performance acoustics it was intended for.
In the <em>Architexture Series</em> the resonant sounds created by buildings
in response to the perfromance are not left to chance. Instead, the
whole system of performers, space, and the musical score is treated as a
sound-making environment which can be designed for. This work builds
on traditional ideas of writing music for a particular space but
re-thinks some of the inherent relationships involved. It attempts to
use the space itself as a live sonic performer within an ensemble - an
active contributor to an unfolding composition - rather than as a
static &lsquo;effect&rsquo;. Through designing structured ways to provoke
reverberation, to blur certain harmonies and not others, to respond to
particular spatial locations and not others, opens up new
compositional possibilities. This is only possible through detailed
acoustical analysis and a composition process which makes use of this
information as an evidence-base for sculpting lines and harmonies.</p>

<p>The <em>Architexture Series</em> presently comprises three explorations into
this area through addressing the layering of past and present within a
heritage building (The Guildhall, York), a large-scale openair public
Augmented Reality Presentation (European researcher&rsquo;s night), and a
spatially recorded piece of audio under controlled studio
conditions.New relationships between the audience, the performance site
and performers emerge from these bespoke pieces of music for
voices. <em>Architexture I</em> and <em>Architexture 2</em> both draw on a
combination of Renaissance influenced musical craft and spatial data
provided through contemporary digital techniques.</p>

<h2 id="sites-resonances-and-history">Sites, resonances, and history</h2>

<p>Reverberation has always been attractive to me as a composer: the joy
of hearing performances where buildings make a unique contribution
to the event is a thrilling experience. However, I started to wonder
about how composers might further design the effects the building was
producing alongside designing the musical score itself. Setting
aside famous examples such as Gabrielli, many composers tend to think
about the acoustic in every aspect of the music they make, looking for
clarity of presentation or whether certain textures will simply &lsquo;work&rsquo;
in a space. The environment has an imprint on the types and styles of
music what we create. I wanted to take this idea a little further, and
explore how the sounds of the performance site could be generated and
manipulated by the ensemble: building an ensemble as a unified system,
extending and challenging the concept of performance &lsquo;for&rsquo; a space. Alvin Lucier&rsquo;s piece, <em>I am sitting in a room</em> plays
back a room&rsquo;s particular resonance into itself, converting the
resonance to a sound source in its own right. There are no other sound
sources in Lucier&rsquo;s piece, nor are there any performers. I wanted to
harness this now familiar relationship (the idea of &lsquo;room tone&rsquo;, as
filmmakers would put it) and take it to a new level: what happens
when that resonance itself is manipulated by the performance. To do
this required knowing about the detailed acoustic response of venues
in advance of composing, and the construction of a computer modelling
system so that the notated results of the musical composition could be
visualised as harmony with a detailed reverberation profile of the
building factored in. My method for doing this is discussed in a
research chapter in <a href="https://ambrosefield.github.io/research/compresonance/">this publication</a>.
With these tools, when it came to putting notes on the page I could
understand the effects and contribution the building would make to the
totality of the sounding experience the audience would be immersed
within.</p>

<p>It would be relatively straightforward to map reverberant data points as a kind of sonification. (Sonification doesn&rsquo;t rule out musicality - it is just a different type of process). Instead,  data here in the Architexture Series informs a process where the music I write for performers is shaped and moulded appropriately, treating the reverberation as a line or part in its own right in what is already a dynamic, complex system of interactions. This creates a piece of <em>live-art</em>: the existing building having it&rsquo;s role changed and adapted by the music.</p>

<p>In <em>Architexture II</em>, we worked with a building that doesn&rsquo;t presently exist today through reconstruction and modelling of that space, brought alive by music which specifically uses those spatial characteristics, presented as an audio Augmented Reality. See the  <a href="https://ambrosefield.github.io/research/architexture2/">Architexture II page</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="multi-disciplinary-collaboration">Multi-disciplinary collaboration</h2>

<p>Architexture is a multi-disciplinary project which would not be possible without arts-science collaboration, made possible at the University of York, UK. Often, Art is used as a demonstrator or engagement tool for science, but in this case, acoustic engineering (here in the form of the capture of impulse responses) is a key enabler in creating new forms of immersive public experience through musical craft. Through new music designed to explore site in new ways (rather than through the performance of existing work), creating a situation where the audience are less observers and more participants. The overlay of space and place allows us to think critically about the sites, buildings and the communities which make (or have made) use of them.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-contemporary-perspectives-to-historical-architecture">Bringing contemporary perspectives to historical architecture</h2>

<p>The architexture project has involved creating bespoke music for sites of historic, cultural and acoustic interest. In the heritage context, we have rejected ideas of providing a kind of &lsquo;audio time travel&rsquo; (or taking the audience back to a particular period in time) in favour of creating a situation where the public can experience the past and present together in a unified way through immersive music - inviting thoughtful engagement through personal comparison between past and present.</p>
